# Where's That Witch? - Session Notes
**Date:** October 11, 2025 - 15:15
**Session:** Project Initialization

## Current State

This is a brand new project called "Where's That Witch?" located in the `/games/wheresThatWitch/` folder within the Halloween games collection.

### What Was Done This Session

1. Created project documentation folder structure
2. Initialized baseline documentation files:
   - `specifications.md` - for design decisions and game mechanics
   - `specifications-technical.md` - for technical implementation details
   - This file - for session notes and continuity

### Current Project Structure

## Next Steps

### Immediate ToDo Items
1. Define the game concept and mechanics
   - What type of game is "Where's That Witch?"
   - Core gameplay loop
   - Scoring system
   - Win/loss conditions

2. Decide on project structure
   - Standalone game vs. integrated with main Halloween games app
   - File organization
   - Asset requirements

3. Create initial game scaffold
   - HTML structure
   - CSS styling framework
   - JavaScript game logic foundation

### Long-Term ToDo Items
- Design and create game assets (images, sounds)
- Implement game mechanics
- Add animations and visual effects
- Integrate with main Halloween games collection (if desired)
- Testing and refinement
- Documentation updates

## Technical Notes

- Project follows John's preferences for simple, well-documented code
- Incremental development approach - build baseline scaffold first
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) for easy understanding
- Compatible with GitHub Pages deployment

## Questions to Address

1. Game concept: What is the core gameplay mechanic?
2. Visual style: What Halloween theme elements to incorporate?
3. Integration: Should this be a standalone game or part of the main Halloween games app?
4. Scope: What's the initial MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?
