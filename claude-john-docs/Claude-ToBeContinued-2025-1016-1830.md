# Who's That Witch? - Session Notes
**Date:** October 16, 2025 - 18:30
**Session:** Bug Fix - Special Tile Selection Reset
**Version:** v0.09

## Current State

The "Who's That Witch?" game now has complete tile flipping mechanics with proper state management for special tiles (bombs and bonus). Players can flip tiles to reveal witch images, match pairs, and special tiles correctly reset the game state.

### What Was Done This Session

1. **Fixed Special Tile Bug**
   - **Problem:** When a player selected a gameTile first, then clicked a bomb/bonus tile, the first gameTile would stay revealed indefinitely
   - **Root Cause:** `handleSpecialTile()` was clearing the `selectedTiles` array but not hiding previously selected gameTiles
   - **Solution:** Added code to iterate through `selectedTiles` array before clearing it
   - **Implementation:**
     - Check each tile in selectedTiles
     - If tile is a gameTile (not the special tile itself), flip it back face-down
     - Set face-down image opacity to 1
     - Update isFaceUp to false
     - Remove golden highlight
   - **File Modified:** `js/whosThatWitch.js` (lines 867-875)
   - **Result:** Game state now properly resets after special tile click

2. **User UI Refinements**
   - User adjusted title and subtitle positioning (CSS changes)
   - Subtitle simplified to "Match the witches and then name them!"
   - Character list padding adjusted to 60px top

- ❌ Victory screen not implemented
- ❌ Bomb tile effects/penalties not defined
- ❌ Bonus tile effects/rewards not defined

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Phase 3 - Character Selection & Identification

**Goal:** Complete the three-click game mechanic

**Three-Click Workflow:**
1. **Click 1:** Player clicks a face-down tile → flips to face-up, reveals witch image ✅ DONE
2. **Click 2:** Player clicks another face-down tile → flips to face-up, reveals witch image ✅ DONE
3. **Click 3:** Player clicks character name in list → identifies the character ❌ TO DO

**After Third Click - Validation Logic:**
- **If tiles match (same pairId) AND character name is correct:**
  - Mark both tiles as "completed" (keep face-up, add visual indicator)
  - Mark character in list as "identified/completed"
  - Update character's "+10" points (mark as earned)
  - Update Clicks counter (actual click tracking)
  - Update TOTAL SCORE
  - Allow player to continue with remaining tiles

- **If tiles DON'T match OR character name is wrong:**
  - Flip both tiles back to face-down
  - No points earned
  - Increment Clicks counter (penalty)
  - Allow player to try again

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Make Character Names Clickable**
   - Add click event listeners to `.character-name` elements
   - Add cursor pointer styling
   - Only allow clicking during `WAITING_FOR_WITCH_SELECTION` state

2. **Character Identification Validation**
   - When character name clicked, get its name_text
   - Compare with name_text from both selected tiles
   - Determine if correct or incorrect

3. **Handle Correct Identification**
   - Keep both tiles face-up permanently
   - Add "completed" visual indicator to tiles
   - Mark character in list as completed (color change, strikethrough?)
   - Update scoring displays
   - Reset game state to WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE

4. **Handle Incorrect Identification**
   - Flip both tiles back face-down (reuse hideNonMatchingTiles logic)
   - No visual changes to character list
   - Reset game state to WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE

5. **Track Actual Scoring**
   - Implement click counter (increment on each tile click)
   - Track characters identified correctly
   - Calculate total score (character points - click penalties)
   - Update display in real-time

### Medium-Term Tasks

**Asset Improvements:**
1. **Better Tile Back Design**
   - Current back images are placeholder broom designs
   - Consider more polished Halloween-themed backs
   - Possibly multiple design options in assets/other/

2. **Bomb Tile Imagery**
   - Current bomb tile needs better visual
   - Should clearly indicate it's a penalty/danger tile

3. **Bonus Tile Imagery**
   - Current bonus tile needs better visual
   - Should clearly indicate it's a reward tile

**Bomb & Bonus Mechanics Design:**
1. **Bomb Tile Effects (Ideas to Evaluate)**
   - Option A: Deduct points from total score (-20 points?)
   - Option B: Add extra clicks to penalty counter (+5 clicks?)
   - Option C: Flip all currently revealed tiles back face-down
   - Option D: Mute/darken one random character in list (can't select)
   - **Decision Needed:** Which effect is most fun/balanced?

2. **Bonus Tile Effects (Ideas to Evaluate)**
   - Option A: Add bonus points to score (+20 points?)
   - Option B: Reduce click penalty (-5 clicks?)
   - Option C: Reveal a random matched pair temporarily (3 seconds)
   - Option D: Auto-complete one character (mark as identified)
   - **Decision Needed:** Which effect is most rewarding?

### Long-Term Tasks

**Game Completion:**
- Detect when all gameTile pairs matched and identified
- Trigger victory screen
- Display final score breakdown
- Show statistics (matches found, characters identified, total clicks, etc.)
- Offer "Play Again" button

**Polish & Enhancements:**
- Sound effects (tile flip, match found, special tile, victory)
- Particle effects for successful matches
- Timer mode (optional challenge mode)
- High score tracking (localStorage)
- Difficulty-specific achievements

## Technical Notes

### Game State Machine (v0.09)

**Current States:**
1. `WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE` - No tiles selected, ready for first click
2. `WAITING_FOR_SECOND_TILE` - One tile selected, waiting for second click
3. `WAITING_FOR_WITCH_SELECTION` - Two matching tiles revealed, waiting for character name click
4. `CHECKING_MATCH` - Validating if two tiles match, blocks further clicks

**State Transitions:**
- `WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE` → (click gameTile) → `WAITING_FOR_SECOND_TILE`
- `WAITING_FOR_SECOND_TILE` → (click gameTile) → `CHECKING_MATCH` → checkForMatch()
- In checkForMatch():
  - If match: → `WAITING_FOR_WITCH_SELECTION`
  - If no match: → (after delay) → `WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE`
- Special tiles: Any state → (click bomb/bonus) → `CHECKING_MATCH` → handleSpecialTile() → `WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE`

**Phase 3 Will Add:**
- New state or use existing `WAITING_FOR_WITCH_SELECTION`
- Character name click handler
- Validation logic
- Transition back to `WAITING_FOR_FIRST_TILE` after identification

### Bug Fix Details - handleSpecialTile()

**Before (v0.08):**
```javascript
// Mark as matched so it can't be clicked again
tileContainer.dataset.isMatched = "true";

// Clear selected tiles
selectedTiles = [];  // ❌ Clears array without hiding previous tiles
```

**After (v0.09):**
```javascript
// Mark as matched so it can't be clicked again
tileContainer.dataset.isMatched = "true";

// Hide any previously selected gameTiles before clearing
selectedTiles.forEach(tile => {
  if (tile !== tileContainer && tile.dataset.type === 'gameTile') {
    const faceDownImg = tile.querySelector('.tile-face-down');
    faceDownImg.style.opacity = '1';
    tile.dataset.isFaceUp = "false";
    tile.classList.remove('tile-selected');
  }
});

// Clear selected tiles
selectedTiles = [];  // ✅ Now safe to clear, previous tiles already hidden
```

## Development Philosophy

Following John's preferences:
- **Simple, incremental approach:** Build one feature at a time
- **Easy to understand:** Clear code over clever optimizations
- **Well-documented:** Explain "why" not just "what"
- **Functional patterns:** Prefer pure functions where possible
- **Wait for approval:** Don't implement major features without discussion
- **Accept good enough:** Perfect is enemy of done
