# Who's That Witch? - Specifications

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Who's That Witch?
**Project Type:** Halloween-themed matching/memory tile game
**Location:** `/games/whosThatWitch/`
**Status:** Grid System Complete, Character Database Ready, Next: Random Selection
**Date Started:** October 11, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025 - 16:20

## Project Concept

A matching tile game where players:
1. Turn over tiles to reveal witch character images
2. Match two identical tiles together
3. Identify which witch character is shown (this is the twist!)
4. Score points based on matches and correct identification

**The Core Gameplay:** Players flip tiles to find matching pairs of witch characters. Once a match is found, they must correctly identify which witch it is to score points and continue playing.

## Game Container Specifications

**Exact Dimensions:** 950√ó714 pixels
- **Width:** 950px (exact)
- **Height:** 714px (not 720px - see rationale below)
- **Borders:** 3px white border (inside the container)
- **Background:** Black (#000000)
- **Position:** Relative, centered in page

**Rationale for 714px Height:**
The game is designed to fit inside a parent Halloween minigames app. The parent app has a center panel of 950√ó720 pixels, but 3px borders on top and bottom reduce usable space to 950√ó714. This ensures the game fits perfectly without overflow.

## Board Specifications

**Container:** 502√ó502 pixels
- **Position:** Absolute, bottom-left of screen
  - 35px from left edge (20px + 15px border)
  - 35px from bottom edge (20px + 15px border)
- **Border:** 15px ridge border (#7b2d8e - witchy purple)
  - Box-sizing: content-box (border is outside the 502px)
  - Total size with border: 532√ó532 pixels
- **Background:** #553963 (purple interior)
- **Purpose:** Contains the grid of tiles and grid lines

## Grid System

Three difficulty levels with different grid sizes:

### Easy (3√ó3 Grid)
- **Tile Count:** 9 tiles
- **Tile Size:** 166√ó166 pixels
- **Grid Lines:** 2px white lines between tiles
- **Total Calculation:** 3√ó166 + 2√ó2 = 498 + 4 = 502px ‚úì
- **Characters:** 9 different witches selected

### Medium (4√ó4 Grid)
- **Tile Count:** 16 tiles
- **Tile Size:** 124√ó124 pixels
- **Grid Lines:** 2px white lines between tiles
- **Total Calculation:** 4√ó124 + 3√ó2 = 496 + 6 = 502px ‚úì
- **Characters:** 16 different witches selected

### Hard (5√ó5 Grid)
- **Tile Count:** 25 tiles
- **Tile Size:** 99√ó99 pixels
- **Grid Lines:** 2px white lines between tiles
- **Total Calculation:** 5√ó99 + 4√ó2 = 495 + 8 = 503px (1px hidden under border)
- **Characters:** 20 witches selected (only 20 total available)

## Asset Inventory

### Witch Character Images

**Total Characters:** 20 unique witch characters
**Total Images:** 76 individual photos (multiple photos per character)
**Source Material:** Movies, TV shows, books, anime, cartoons
**Image Formats:** PNG with transparency (RGBA)

**Available Sizes:**
- 166√ó166 pixels (stored in `assets/166sized/`) - For EASY difficulty
- 124√ó124 pixels (stored in `assets/124sized/`) - For MEDIUM difficulty
- 99√ó99 pixels (stored in `assets/99sized/`) - For HARD difficulty
- Original: Various sizes (stored in `assets/witches/`)

### Character Database

**Storage:** `json/witchesImages.json`

**Structure:** Character-grouped with metadata
```json
{
  "witchImages": {
    "Elphaba": [
      {
        "filename": "Elphaba(Broadway_Oz)01",
        "name_text": "Elphaba",
        "description_text": "This is Elphaba, from the 2003 Broadway show Wicked!",
        "easy_path": "99sized",
        "medium_path": "124sized",
        "hard_path": "166sized"
      },
      ...more images for this character...
    ],
    "Samantha": [...],
    ...more characters...
  }
}
```

**Character List (20 characters, 76 total images):**
1. Elphaba (9 images) - Wicked, Wizard of Oz
2. Galinda/Glinda (7 images) - Wicked, Wizard of Oz
3. Endora (3 images) - Bewitched
4. Grandmama (3 images) - The Addams Family
5. Hermione (3 images) - Harry Potter

## Configuration System

**Master Config:** `json/gameConfig.json`

The entire game is controlled by configuration files, making it theme-agnostic:

```json
{
  "theme": "witches",
  "assetFolder": "assets",
  "folderPattern": "{size}sized",
  "filePattern": "{basename}_{size}.png",
  "imageListFile": "json/witchImages.json",
  "gridConfigFile": "json/tileSizes.json",
  "boardDimensions": {
    "width": 502,
    "height": 502
  },
  "difficulties": [
    {"id": "hardTiles", "label": "HARD", "buttonId": "btn-hard"},
    {"id": "mediumTiles", "label": "MEDIUM", "buttonId": "btn-medium"},
    {"id": "easyTiles", "label": "EASY", "buttonId": "btn-easy"}
  ],
  "defaultDifficulty": "mediumTiles"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Change theme to baseball: just swap config and images
- No code changes needed for new themes
- All paths, patterns, dimensions configurable
- Buttons generated dynamically from config

## Design Decisions

### Visual Design

**Color Palette (Halloween Theme):**
- **Screen Background:** Black (#000000)
- **Screen Border:** White (#ffffff), 3px
- **Board Background:** Purple (#553963)
- **Board Border:** Purple ridge (#7b2d8e), 15px
- **Grid Lines:** White, 2px
- **Button Primary:** Orange (#ff6600)
- **Button Hover:** Lighter orange (#ff8c42)

**Layout:**
- Board positioned in bottom-left (asymmetric, visually interesting)
- Buttons centered at top
- Plenty of negative space around board

### Game Mechanics (Partially Implemented)

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Grid displays with correct tile positions
- ‚úÖ Random images load (from simple array)
- ‚úÖ Grid lines draw between tiles
- ‚úÖ Three difficulty levels function

**To Be Implemented:**
- ‚ùå Character-based random selection (pick characters, then one image each)
- ‚ùå Tile flip interaction (face-down ‚Üí face-up)
- ‚ùå Match detection
- ‚ùå Witch identification input/validation
- ‚ùå Scoring system

### Random Selection Strategy

**Algorithm (To Be Implemented):**
1. Load character-grouped database (`witchesImages.json`)
2. Get array of all character names (keys)
3. Shuffle character names randomly
4. Select N characters (9, 16, or 25 based on difficulty)
5. For each selected character, pick one random image from their array
6. Build image paths using config patterns
7. Store character metadata for identification feature

**Why Character-Based:**
- Prevents duplicate characters in same game
- Enables "Who's That Witch?" identification challenge
- Each game has variety of different characters
- Metadata available for hints/descriptions

## Parent App Integration

**Parent App:** Halloween Minigames at `/halloween/index.html`

**Integration Requirements (Future):**
- Export default class from `whosThatWitch.js`
- Implement interface: `constructor()`, `render()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `getScore()`
- Parent will dynamically import and instantiate
- Game HTML injected into parent's `#game-content` div

**Current Status:** Standalone development mode

## Rationale

### Why Character-Grouped Database?
The `witchesImages.json` structure groups images by character rather than using a flat array. This allows:
- Selection of unique characters per game
- Metadata for identification feature (name, description)
- Prevents same character appearing twice
- Educational aspect (players learn character origins)

### Why Configuration-Driven?
Every aspect controlled by JSON files because:
- Easy theme switching (witches ‚Üí baseball ‚Üí Pokemon)
- No code changes needed for new content
- All customization in one master config file
- Buttons, paths, patterns all declarative

### Why Three Difficulty Levels?
- **Easy (3√ó3):** Quick games, larger tiles, easier to see/match
- **Medium (4√ó4):** Standard difficulty, balanced gameplay
- **Hard (5√ó5):** Maximum characters (all 20!), challenging memory test

### Why 502√ó502 Board?
Math works perfectly for all three grid sizes:
- Easy: 3√ó166 + 2√ó2 = 502 ‚úì
- Medium: 4√ó124 + 3√ó2 = 502 ‚úì
- Hard: 5√ó99 + 4√ó2 = 503 (1px under frame border) ‚úì

## Current Implementation Status

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Screen and board layout (950√ó714, 502√ó502)
- ‚úÖ Grid system with three difficulties
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculated tile positions
- ‚úÖ Grid line rendering
- ‚úÖ Dynamic button generation
- ‚úÖ Configuration system (fully theme-agnostic)
- ‚úÖ Image processing script (166/124/99 sizes)
- ‚úÖ Character database with full metadata
- ‚úÖ Random image loading (simple array version)

**In Progress:**
- üîÑ Character-based random selection (next task)
- üîÑ Update to use witchesImages.json

**Not Started:**
- ‚ùå Tile flip functionality
- ‚ùå Face-down tile design
- ‚ùå Match detection logic
- ‚ùå Witch identification UI
- ‚ùå Scoring system
- ‚ùå Game win/completion
- ‚ùå Instructions screen

## Development Philosophy

Following John's preferences:
- **Incremental development:** One feature at a time, test thoroughly
- **Simple, understandable code:** Readability over optimization
- **Well-documented:** Clear comments explaining "why"
- **Functional approach:** Prefer functional patterns
- **Configuration over code:** Everything in JSON files
- **Wait for approval:** Don't implement major features without confirmation

## Next Major Tasks

1. **Update random selection** to use character database (immediate)
2. **Design tile back** appearance for face-down state
3. **Implement tile flip** interaction and animation
4. **Add match detection** logic
5. **Create identification UI** for "Who's That Witch?"
6. **Implement scoring** system
7. **Add game completion** detection and win screen
