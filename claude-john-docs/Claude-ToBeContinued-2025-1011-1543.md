# Where's That Witch? - Session Notes
**Date:** October 11, 2025 - 15:43
**Session:** Asset Processing & Documentation Setup

## Current State

The "Where's That Witch?" project is in the asset preparation phase. We have successfully processed a collection of 76 witch character images from various media sources and created the initial project documentation structure.

### What Was Done This Session

1. **Initial Documentation Setup** (earlier today)
   - Created baseline `specifications.md` file
   - Created baseline `specifications-technical.md` file
   - Established documentation workflow

2. **Asset Processing** (completed this session)
   - Discovered 76 witch character PNG images in `assets/witches/` folder
   - Installed Pillow (PIL) library v11.3.0 for Python image processing
   - Created `resize_witch_images.py` - a reusable batch image resizing script
   - Successfully processed all 76 images into two standard sizes:
     - 132x132 pixels (saved to `assets/132sized/`)
     - 176x176 pixels (saved to `assets/176sized/`)
   - Verified all 152 output images (76 × 2 sizes) were created correctly

3. **Documentation Updates** (this update)
   - Updated specifications.md with character roster and asset inventory
   - Updated specifications-technical.md with image processing details
   - Created this continuation file

### Character Collection

The game features 76 witch characters from diverse media:
- **TV Shows:** Bewitched, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, The Addams Family, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Game of Thrones, True Blood, The Worst Witch
- **Movies:** Wizard of Oz, Wicked, Harry Potter series, Narnia, Looney Tunes
- **Anime:** Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away
- **Theater:** Broadway productions of Oz and Wicked

Each character has multiple image variations (typically 2-6 images per character).

## Next Steps

### Immediate ToDo Items

1. **Define Game Concept**
   - Determine specific game mechanic: "Where's Waldo" style search? Memory matching? Quiz/identification?
   - Decide on scoring system
   - Define win/loss conditions
   - Plan difficulty progression (if applicable)

2. **Design Game Layout**
   - Choose between standalone game or integration with main Halloween games app
   - Design UI layout (likely 1280x720 to match main app)
   - Decide which image size to use (132x132 or 176x176) based on layout needs
   - Plan game area, controls, score display, instructions

3. **Create Initial Game Scaffold**
   - HTML structure
   - CSS styling framework (Halloween theme)
   - JavaScript game logic foundation
   - Image loading and display system

### Long-Term ToDo Items

- Implement core game mechanics
- Add character name/source metadata system
- Create animations and transitions
- Add sound effects (if desired)
- Implement difficulty levels or progressive challenges
- Add high score tracking
- Test across different browsers
- Optimize image loading performance
- Consider integration with main Halloween games collection
- Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Technical Notes

### Image Processing Details
- **Resampling Method:** LANCZOS algorithm chosen for high-quality downsampling
- **Format:** All images maintain RGBA format for transparency support
- **Naming Convention:** Descriptive names with character and source, e.g., `Hermione(Harry_Potter)01.png`
- **Script Reusability:** The resize script can be re-run if new witch images are added

### Development Approach
- Following John's preference for incremental development
- Building well-documented, easy-to-understand code
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) for simplicity
- Will wait for approval before implementing specific features

### Python Environment Note
- Pillow installed via pip3 for Python 3.13
- Script runs with `python3.13` command (aliased as `python`)
- Local development server available: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

## Questions to Address in Next Session

1. **Game Type:** What specific gameplay mechanic should we implement?
   - Hidden object search (like "Where's Waldo")?
   - Memory/matching game?
   - Identification quiz?
   - Timed challenge?
   - Other idea?

2. **Difficulty:** Should the game have multiple difficulty levels?
   - Easy: Fewer characters on screen
   - Hard: More characters, similar-looking witches
   - Timed vs. untimed mode?

3. **Integration:** Standalone game or part of main Halloween games app?

4. **Metadata:** Do we need a JSON file with character names, sources, and other info for each image?

5. **Scope:** What's the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the first playable version?

## Resources Available

- 76 unique witch characters with 2-6 images each
- Images in 3 sizes: original, 132x132, and 176x176
- Reusable image processing script
- Main Halloween games app architecture (if integration desired)
