# Who's That Witch? - Session Notes
**Date:** October 12, 2025 - 14:00
**Session:** Project Reset and Clean Baseline Establishment

## Current State

The "Who's That Witch?" project has been reset to a clean baseline. All previous experimental code (tile positioning editor, drag-and-drop functionality, scattered layout system) has been removed. The project now consists of minimal foundational files ready for fresh implementation of the game concept.

### What Was Done This Session

1. **Project Reset**
   - Removed all position editor code and experimental features
   - Stripped down HTML to minimal structure with just game div
   - Cleaned CSS to only include reset, body styling, and game container
   - Reduced JavaScript to simple initialization and dimension verification

2. **Image Processing Script Updated**
   - Modified `resize_witch_images.py` to create three new image sizes:
     - 166×166 pixels → `assets/166sized/`
     - 124×124 pixels → `assets/124sized/`
     - 99×99 pixels → `assets/99sized/`
   - Removed old sizes (70, 132, 176) from script
   - Script ready to run when image size is chosen

3. **Parent App Integration Verified**
   - Reviewed parent Halloween app architecture
   - Confirmed 950×714 dimensions will fit perfectly in parent's 950×720 center panel
   - Documented ES6 module export requirements for integration
   - Verified parent app uses dynamic imports and calls render() method

4. **Documentation Reset**
   - Deleted old documentation that described previous iteration
   - Created fresh specifications.md with current project state
   - Created fresh specifications-technical.md with integration details
   - Created this ToBeContinued file for session continuity

```

**Legacy folders that may exist (can be deleted):**
- `assets/70sized/`, `assets/132sized/`, `assets/176sized/`
- `squarePositions/` folder

### Key Technical Details

**Game Container:**
- Exactly 950×714 pixels
- No borders, no padding
- Dark brown background (#2a1f1a)
- Will fit in parent app's 950×720 center panel with 6px vertical margin

**Current Code State:**
- HTML: Just the game div wrapper
- CSS: Reset + body styling + game container
- JS: Initialization that logs "Game loaded" and verifies 950×714 dimensions

**Assets Available:**
- 76 unique witch character images (PNG with transparency)
- Original images in `assets/witches/` ready to be resized
- Resize script ready to create 166/124/99px versions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Decisions Needed (Before Implementing)

1. **Choose Image Size**
   - 99×99 pixels? (small, many tiles fit)
   - 124×124 pixels? (medium size)
   - 166×166 pixels? (larger, more visible)
   - Decision impacts: tile count, layout, visibility

2. **Decide Tile Count**
   - 12 tiles = 6 pairs (easier, quicker game)
   - 16 tiles = 8 pairs (classic memory game size)
   - 20 tiles = 10 pairs (harder, longer game)
   - Decision impacts: layout approach, difficulty

3. **Layout Strategy**
   - Grid layout (organized rows/columns)
   - Centered grid
   - Custom positioning
   - Decision impacts: CSS approach, responsiveness

4. **Tile Back Design**
   - Solid color with icon?
   - Halloween pattern?
   - Image-based back?
   - Decision impacts: assets needed, visual theme

### Implementation Sequence (After Decisions Made)

1. **Run Image Resize Script**
   - Choose tile size (99, 124, or 166)
   - Run `python3 resize_witch_images.py` to create images
   - Verify output in appropriate `assets/XXXsized/` folder

2. **Create Basic Tile HTML/CSS**
   - Design single tile structure
   - Create face-down (back) appearance
   - Create face-up (image) appearance
   - Style with chosen dimensions

3. **Implement Tile Layout**
   - Based on chosen approach (grid/custom)
   - Position tiles in game container
   - Ensure proper spacing and alignment

4. **Add Flip Interaction**
   - Click handler for tile flip
   - Flip animation (CSS transform)
   - Prevent flipping already-flipped tiles
   - Track flipped tiles

5. **Implement Match Logic**
   - Detect when 2 tiles are flipped
   - Check if images match
   - Handle match success (keep revealed)
   - Handle match failure (flip back)

6. **Add Witch Identification**
   - UI for entering witch name after match
   - Character name database
   - Validate answer
   - Provide feedback (correct/incorrect)

7. **Implement Scoring System**
   - Points for matches
   - Bonus for correct identification
   - Display score
   - Track game completion

8. **Polish and Testing**
   - Instructions screen
   - Reset/new game button
   - Win screen
   - Bug testing

### Long-Term Items

- Sound effects
- Animations and transitions
- Multiple difficulty levels
- High score tracking
- Integration with parent Halloween app (ES6 module export)
- Mobile/touch support (if desired)

## Questions for Next Session

1. **What tile size should we use?** 99px, 124px, or 166px?
2. **How many tiles/pairs?** 12, 16, or 20 tiles total?
3. **What layout approach?** Grid or custom?
4. **What should tile backs look like?** Design preference?
5. **Witch identification method?** Text input or multiple choice?

## Development Approach Reminder

Following John's preferences:
- Build incrementally, one feature at a time
- Simple, readable code over complex optimizations
- Test each feature before moving to next
- Wait for approval on major decisions
- Document clearly with helpful comments

## Resources Available

- 76 unique witch character images ready to use
- Resize script configured for three size options
- Clean baseline code ready to build on
- Parent app integration architecture documented
- Halloween color palette and theme established
