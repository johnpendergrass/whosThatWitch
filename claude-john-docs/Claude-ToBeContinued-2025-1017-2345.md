# Who's That Witch? - Session Notes
**Date:** October 17, 2025 - 23:45
**Session:** BOMB-A/BOMB-B Separation & Special Tile Setup
**Version:** v0.12

## Current State

The "Who's That Witch?" game has completed the separation of bomb tiles into BOMB-A and BOMB-B types with dedicated handlers! Both types are now ready for custom effects implementation.

### What Was Done This Session

#### 1. **Separated Bomb Tiles into BOMB-A and BOMB-B**
   - **Previous State:** Single generic "bomb" type
   - **New State:** Two distinct bomb types with separate images and handlers
   - **File Modified:** `js/whosThatWitch.js`
   - **Changes:**
     - Updated `selectImagesForDifficulty()` to create separate `bombsA` and `bombsB` arrays
     - BOMB-A: First bomb (Medium/Hard), uses `_bombTileA_{size}.png`
     - BOMB-B: Second bomb (Hard only), uses `_bombTileB_{size}.png`
     - Return object structure: `{gameTiles, bombsA, bombsB, bonus}`

#### 2. **Created Dedicated Bomb Handlers**
   - **Created:** `handleBombATile()` function (lines 1088-1102)
   - **Created:** `handleBombBTile()` function (lines 1104-1118)
   - **Modified:** `handleTileClick()` to route bombA and bombB separately
   - **Modified:** `handleSpecialTile()` updated JSDoc comment
   - **Result:** Each bomb type has its own handler, ready for custom effects

#### 3. **Fixed Halftone Application for Bomb Tiles**
   - **Problem:** Bomb tiles weren't getting halftone overlay, only muted opacity
   - **Fix:** Updated `handleSpecialTile()` to apply halftone (like bonus tile)
   - **Result:** All special tiles (bombA, bombB, bonus) get halftone when clicked

#### 4. **Updated All References to Use bombA/bombB**
   - **Removed:** All generic "bomb" references
   - **Updated:** `assignTilesToPositions()` to spread `bombsA` and `bombsB`
   - **Updated:** `checkGameCompletion()` to check for both bombA and bombB types
   - **Updated:** JSDoc comments to reflect new structure
   - **Result:** No generic "bomb" type remains in codebase

#### 5. **Attempted BOMB-A Shuffle Effect (Reverted)**
   - **Goal:** Shuffle all unrevealed witch tiles to random positions
   - **Implementation:** Full shuffle algorithm with instant repositioning
   - **Decision:** User wanted to revert and reconsider approach
   - **Action:** Used `git restore js/whosThatWitch.js` to revert changes
   - **Reason:** Want to finalize design before implementing
   - **Git Backup:** User created commit before attempting shuffle

## Current Testing Status

**What Works:**
- ✅ Three difficulty levels (Easy 3×3, Medium 4×4, Hard 5×5)
- ✅ Black grid lines between tiles
- ✅ Random witch selection from all 25 characters (equal probability)
- ✅ Unique pairId generation (no collisions)
- ✅ Matching pairs with pairId tracking
- ✅ BOMB-A and BOMB-B tiles with dedicated images (separate types)
- ✅ Bonus tile with dedicated image
- ✅ Adjacency constraint algorithm (special tiles, matching pairs)
- ✅ Character list displays with correct unique witches
- ✅ 2 decoy witches (properly filtered from actual game witches)
- ✅ Tile flipping (face-down ↔ face-up)
- ✅ Match detection (compare pairIds)
- ✅ BOMB-A, BOMB-B, bonus tiles handle correctly (separate handlers)
- ✅ Game state machine prevents invalid clicks
- ✅ Golden glow on selected tiles
- ✅ Character names clickable (only during WAITING_FOR_WITCH_SELECTION)
- ✅ Character validation (correct vs incorrect)
- ✅ Success tooltip (green) with smart timing
- ✅ Error tooltip (red) with smart timing
- ✅ Completed characters turn yellow with checkmark
- ✅ Hover on completed character highlights tiles on grid
- ✅ Hover tooltips only for completed witches
- ✅ Character hover color change (orange → white)
- ✅ No duplicate witch names in character list
- ✅ All tiles place correctly (no purple squares)
- ✅ Game completion detection
- ✅ Decoy strikethrough when all witches found
- ✅ Auto-reveal unrevealed special tiles at game end
- ✅ Halftone applied to ALL special tiles at game end
- ✅ "WHO AM I?" banner activates/deactivates correctly
- ✅ **NEW v0.12: BOMB-A and BOMB-B separated with distinct handlers**
- ✅ **NEW v0.12: All special tiles get halftone overlay when clicked**

**What Needs Work:**
- ❌ BOMB-A tile effect/action when clicked (handler exists, needs implementation)
- ❌ BOMB-B tile effect/action when clicked (handler exists, needs implementation)
- ❌ Bonus tile visual flash effect (currently working but could be enhanced)
- ❌ Special tile images (user has created bombTileA and bombTileB images)
- ❌ Click counter implementation and display
- ❌ Best score tracking/display
- ❌ Celebration animation when game completes
- ❌ Victory/completion message overlay

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Special Tile Effects & Scoring

**1. Design BOMB-A Effect**
   - **Decision Needed:** What should BOMB-A do?
   - **Options:**
     - Shuffle remaining unrevealed tiles to random positions (attempted, reverted)
     - Flip all revealed tiles back to face-down
     - Add penalty clicks to counter
     - Time penalty (if adding timer)
     - Show decoy witch (reveal a false character)
   - **Note:** Already has dedicated handler `handleBombATile()`

**2. Design BOMB-B Effect**
   - **Decision Needed:** What should BOMB-B do? (Different from BOMB-A)
   - **Options:**
     - More severe version of BOMB-A effect
     - Different type of penalty (score reduction? lives?)
     - Swap positions of revealed tiles
     - Temporarily disable character list
   - **Note:** Already has dedicated handler `handleBombBTile()`

**3. Update Special Tile Images**
   - User has created `_bombTileA` and `_bombTileB` images
   - Verify images exist in all three size folders (99sized, 124sized, 166sized)
   - Test that images load correctly
   - May also want to update `_bonusTile` image

**4. Click Counter Implementation**
   - Add click counter variable (increments on each tile click)
   - Add UI display element (where? bottom of status box? near difficulty buttons?)
   - Update counter on every tile click
   - Display format: "Clicks: 42" or similar
   - Reset when new game starts

**5. Best Score Display**
   - Track lowest click count per difficulty (Medium/Hard)
   - Store in localStorage (persistent across sessions)
   - Add UI display near difficulty buttons or in status box
   - Display format: "Best: 28 clicks" or similar
   - Update when current game beats best score

**6. Game Completion Celebration**
   - Design celebration overlay/animation
   - Show final stats (clicks, characters found, time?)
   - Display "You Win!" or "Game Complete!" message
   - "Play Again" button
   - Confetti or particle effect?

## Technical Notes

### BOMB-A and BOMB-B Separation (v0.12)

**The Change:**
```javascript
// OLD: Single bomb type
const bombArray = [];
for (let i = 0; i < bombTiles; i++) {
  bombArray.push({ imagePath: bombPath, type: "bomb" });
}

// NEW: Separate bomb types
const bombAArray = [];
if (bombTiles >= 1) {
  bombAArray.push({ imagePath: bombAPath, type: "bombA" });
}

const bombBArray = [];
if (bombTiles >= 2) {
  bombBArray.push({ imagePath: bombBPath, type: "bombB" });
}
```

**Difficulty Distribution:**
- Easy (3×3): 0 bombs
- Medium (4×4): 1 bomb (BOMB-A)
- Hard (5×5): 2 bombs (BOMB-A + BOMB-B)

**Handler Structure:**
```javascript
// Routing in handleTileClick()
if (tileType === "bombA") {
  setTimeout(() => handleBombATile(tileContainer), 1000);
} else if (tileType === "bombB") {
  setTimeout(() => handleBombBTile(tileContainer), 1000);
}

// Dedicated handlers (ready for custom effects)
function handleBombATile(bombTileContainer) {
  // TODO: Add custom BOMB-A effect
  handleSpecialTile(bombTileContainer); // Currently just applies halftone
}

function handleBombBTile(bombTileContainer) {
  // TODO: Add custom BOMB-B effect
  handleSpecialTile(bombTileContainer); // Currently just applies halftone
}
```

### Halftone Application (v0.12 Fix)

**The Problem:**
- Bonus tile applied halftone overlay correctly
- Bomb tiles only showed muted opacity (face-down still visible)

**The Solution:**
```javascript
function handleSpecialTile(tileContainer) {
  // Hide face-down image completely
  faceDownImg.style.opacity = "0";

  // Show halftone overlay
  halftoneImg.style.opacity = "1";

  // (Previously: faceDownImg.style.opacity = mutedOpacity)
}
```

**Result:** All special tiles now get black halftone screen when clicked

### BOMB-A Shuffle Attempt (Reverted)

**What Was Implemented:**
- Added `currentLineSize` global variable
- Full shuffle algorithm that:
  1. Collected all unrevealed gameTiles
  2. Shuffled their square positions
  3. Instantly moved tiles to new positions
  4. Updated dataset.squareNum values
- Handled both 1st-click and 2nd-click cases

**Why Reverted:**
- User wanted to reconsider the approach
- May want different effect for BOMB-A
- Code was fully functional but not desired behavior

**Git Status:**
- Cleanly reverted with `git restore js/whosThatWitch.js`
- User has backup commit before shuffle implementation
- Can re-implement later if desired

## Development Philosophy

Following John's preferences:
- **Simple, incremental approach:** Build one feature at a time
- **Easy to understand:** Clear code over clever optimizations
- **Well-documented:** Explain "why" not just "what"
- **Functional patterns:** Prefer pure functions where possible
- **Wait for approval:** Don't implement major features without discussion
- **Test thoroughly:** Fix bugs completely before moving on
